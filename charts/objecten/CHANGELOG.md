## 2.7.2 (2025-03-12)

## 2.7.0 (2025-01-31)


Stable release with support of [django-setup-configuration](https://github.com/maykinmedia/django-setup-configuration). 

- Fixed the configuration-secrets.yaml template to render only if no existing secret is present in the cluster (needed for example if using sealed secrets).
- Removed the env vars `SITES_CONFIG_ENABLE`, `OBJECTS_OBJECTTYPES_TOKEN` and `OBJECTS_DOMAIN` as these settings are now managed with django-setup-configuration.
- Removed the env vars `OBJECTS_ORGANIZATION`, `DEMO_CONFIG_ENABLE`, `DEMO_PERSON`, `DEMO_EMAIL` because they are not used in the application.

## 2.7.0-beta.0 (2025-01-10)

- [#148] Replace the worker liveness probe with the `celery inspect active` command. This should detect when a worker is down and should not interrupt long running tasks.
- [#119] Update the syntax of the worker liveness probe. The worker probes now can be enabled/disabled with:

```yaml
worker:
  livenessProbe:
    enabled: true # true | false
```
